#How to name terminal tabs

I find myself developing on several different websites at once with several different terminal windows open at once, which can get confusing to have multiple tabs open at once in which the file structure ends on the "dev" branch.  To avoid having to pwd each time, I just discovered that you can name individual bash tabs by hitting Shift+Command+i, and then naming it something more approriate to what I'm doing.
