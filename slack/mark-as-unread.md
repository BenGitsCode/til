# Quickly Mark Messages as Read or Unread

This is a quickie but a good one to have in your back pocket if you're a heavy Slack user.

This is pulled directly from the Slack Keyboard Shortcuts help page, but I may break those up into a few TILs so let's just focus on this one.

The most common use case is that I see a slack message that's important but I need to defer it to future-Ben (that's me in the future) so I just quickly mark it as unread and move on with my life. This of course, only works if you're militant about reading unread messages

That's it. It's small but I `option` + `click` messages at least a few times a day and it really smooths out my slack workflow day-to-day.
