Masonry
======

##### as said in its documentation

> Masonry is a JavaScript grid layout library. It works by placing elements in optimal position based on available vertical space, sort of like a mason fitting stones in a wall. Youâ€™ve probably seen it in use all over the Internet.

----

Although small tidbit of knowledge, this library allows you to grid images easily and allow them to animate upon repositioning and resizing.

I believe I will use it in future projects to build grids quickly while having them look good.
