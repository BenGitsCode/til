About an awesome way to render readme files locally, before pushing them to github.

From it's [README](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip):

> "Grip is a command-line server application written in Python that uses the GitHub markdown API to render a local readme file. The styles come directly from GitHub, so you'll know exactly how it will appear. Changes you make to the Readme will be instantly reflected in the browser without requiring a page refresh."



## Examples of use

Consider showing examples in code blocks, with images/gifs or as a simple markdown list of steps.



## Credit -- always credit any relevant sources below example is a nice format for crediting StackExchange posts. **Nothing is too small to give the source attribution credit.**

**Uses Stack Exchange contributions made by [<nameHere>](<sourceHere>) **
