### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for TIL, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing snippets.

Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion :pencil: and find related suggestions :mag_right:.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Determine which section or directory the enhancement should be suggested for.**
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/BenGitsCode/today-i-learned/issues)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined which directory or section your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue [here](https://github.com/BenGitsCode/today-i-learned/issues/new) and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the current format** and **explain which structure you would prefer to see and why.**

### Your First TIL  Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to TIL?

✨ Don't be! No snippet of knowledge is too small! ✨

Whether it's opening an issue pointing out one of my broken links or just sharing some small code snippet--don't overthink it!

### Pull Requests

* There is currently no formal pull request flow or template, I'm more concerned with making it easy and comfortable for people to share
anything they think is fun, interesting or provides significant utility. I'd love to have a template and I'm open to suggestions.

* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
* Your snippet style and structure is up to you, I haven't developed distinct conventions for their structure and I'm not sure I want to. However works best for you to get it out of your brain and on to github easiest, is the right answer. We can always revise it for clarity or accessibility.


## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally
