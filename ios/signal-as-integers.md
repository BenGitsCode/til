# You Can See Your Signal Strength as Numbers

This isn't any kind of deal-breaker for me but I never did like the little circles and referring to my reception by how many balls I had. Turns out, there's a really easy way to see it as numbers and even set it to use that as the default.

Here's how to change it (you can change it back at any time):

1.  Open the phone app and dial `*3001#12345$*`.
1.  Press the `Call` button.
1.  You're now in `Field Test Mode` and will see the numbers for reception and menus full of other nifty features to play with. If you hit the `Home` button, you'll quit out of the Field Test and the signal indicator will return to dots.


###  **To Set it to always use the Signal Number instead of dots:**:
1.  Follow the first two steps, to enter `Field Test Mode`.
1.  Now hold down the Power button until the `Slide to Power Off` message shows, then release the power button and hold the `Home` button until Field Test quits.

Now they're not only set to the Signal Numbers, but you can toggle back and forth by pressing the the Signal Bars/Numbers.

How to read the Signal Numbers:
The lower the number, the worse (more negative) the signal. The higher the number (less negative) the better the signal.

* Anything above -80 is good, and would be considered full bars.
* Anything below -110 is bad, and would be considered few bars.
