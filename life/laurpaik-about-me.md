# Stuff I learn about myself

This isn't, like, a real one, but I learn new things about myself all the time, and sometimes it's important to have little reminders about it. This'll be more like a bulleted list tbh and I don't really plan on submitting a pull request for this anyway.

## Personality/Trust/Fears

-   I like to think I don't need validation, but I do.
-   I don't like being around large groups of people as much as I thought I did.
-   I have a hard time trusting people who talk too quickly when they pitch something to me.
-   I also have a hard time trusting people who are very clearly withholding information from me.
    -   I'm talking about recruiters, specifically.
-   Unless something overrides this, I cry maybe once every two years. Usually it takes a really sad episode of something. Either way I need to cry more because it's super refreshing... but I'd rather avoid hardcore emotions, so I tend to not.
-   I think I thrive in cult-like environments. I laughed when Maddie said she did, but I mean, we were in crew for the same amount of time and it worked out for both of us. I'm slowly getting sucked into November Project and even though parts of it are weird as hell I'm still enjoying it. Sardines was super fun because literally my only strategy was wander around until I find people clad in neon, and we all ran together instead of me just getting passed for multiple loops like usual. Found a group within 10 minutes and just ran with them the whole time, but we found like three other groups a few times along the way. It was the closest thing I had to a team since crew and it was like a fun scavenger hunt. Still getting used to all the hugging, but now it's kind of nice whereas the first time I went it was just a lot.
-   **I hate the word `smart`.** It's a stupid word that doesn't really mean anything. How do you measure `smart`? Your grades? Your grades don't tell you anything really important. I was told I was smart pretty much K-12 because I had good grades, but I procrastinated a lot and made some terrible decisions because I wasn't good at `learning` at the time. I could retain information if it was interesting enough, but it was more or less recitation, and to me a lot of it was logical sense. I could parse sentences, I could connect dots for math problems, but I didn't see parsing and connecting as useful tools because I couldn't fathom using them outside of school. I didn't appreciate that ability as something I could _use_ to solve real problems. Education is only as good as you make it, and I didn't utilize it well when I was actually in school. GA was probably the first time I really dedicated time to figuring out **how to learn effectively**. Having a growth mindset changed it all-- Focusing on improving more than knowing led to me actually knowing more than I thought. There are times people ask me for help and all I do is break it down to simple terms, but hey, it works.
    <!-- -   Mostly just annoyed because my sister said she wanted to get a summer job and my mom views her in numbers when really my sister is super talented, just not in a strictly academic sense. My sister has imagination and intuition and tbh I don't really care that physics isn't clicking with her because she knows what she likes and she pursues that. My mom says she needs more discipline, but honestly what better discipline is there than getting an annoying, minimum wage service industry job? -->
-   I think I'm afraid of men who raise their voices. Also men who follow women, and I mean really _follow_.

    There's almost never a good reason for it, and for a lot of men it makes them sound unnecessarily violent. (I will say it helps weed them out if they have temper issues that lead to violence, but there are plenty of violent men who know how to appear sympathetic.)
    -   I think yesterday was the first time in a really long time that I was legitimately frightened of a man I didn't know literally just because of how they were talking. It happened a lot more when I was a teen, so it startled me this time, and it threw me off for a full day.
    -   The first time I can really think of off the top of my head was when I was 17 and wandering around Harvard Square and a huge guy started following me and yelling "Konichiwa" at me. When I didn't answer him, he started alternating yelling that and "Ni hao" at me until I made it to my dorm and closed the door behind me.
    -   Fetus Man did this to us a lot. He wasn't actually that big, but he was really scary because he would follow the Planned Parenthood kids around yelling about how we were killing babies. I never got used to it. The cops couldn't do anything because he technically never touched us. He knew they couldn't do anything. He followed me into a building once, and I honest-to-god thought something terrible would happen.
    <!-- -   Jason yelling and banging on Alec and Emmett's door that one time at 4 in the morning. It was the night I was too scared to sleep in my room because I had figured out the night before that he wouldn't take no for an answer and he'd guilt me until I agreed because he was manipulative like that. Emmett literally told him that I didn't want to talk to him and he needed to leave, and it was honestly the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me, but he doesn't know I was awake for it. -->

<!-- -   I'm more afraid of elevators than I remembered. I think a lot of the claustrophobia aspect comes from Jason. I don't know if it's worse to be stuck in one by myself or fine but with too many people. Probably the former, but being afraid of the latter means I'll never be stuck in one with too many people, so there's that. -->

## Gender and Sexuality

-   rant: This may or may not make me a hypocrite, but **I really don't like when dudes use the word 'pussy'.** I've definitely used it before in kind of a humorous context, but never around people I didn't know very well, and I've never used it seriously. It's just one of those words. I wouldn't say 'cunt' in front of people I didn't know either. Idk it's like I'll say 'bitch' every now and then the way straight women say 'girlfriend', but gendered insults aren't really fun when it comes from dudes who use them to demean, especially when one of the people they're referring to is a woman.


-   **I think I love myself more if I take a minute every day to look at myself naked in the mirror.** Bodies are beautiful. I forget that about myself a lot, especially when clothes don't fit properly. When I'm naked and I look at myself in the mirror, I remember I'm beautiful and sexy and cool and _human_.


-   I don't really know when I learned/decided this, but I've started to realize that **love is not just a feeling, it's a commitment.** I think if I'm committed to someone both physically and mentally, I can say I love them. Physical commitment doesn't mean sex, it's a willingness to respect others' physical needs/be there for them. Love comes in different flavors and you can have different kinds of love for different people. **The type of love you have is defined by the level of commitment you have to a person.**
    -   I drive grandma to K-town and carry tables for her and mail her bills.
    -   My parents visit each other even though they don't technically have to and even though financially it'd probably behoove them to not.
    -   Lex and I call each other every now and then. We're both committed to staying in touch. We love each other as friends. Same goes for Xhepa and Cara and Zach and Brian.
    -   Sparkle Motion goes to Jeff's every year. More friend-love.
    -   There's a bunch of people I've met that I'm friends with and really like, but I haven't been committed to staying in touch with them the way I have been for certain other people, so I wouldn't say I love them. They don't really keep in touch either, so it's all gucci.

    <!-- -   Arun and I didn't work out because I wasn't willing to move to bumblefuck Florida for him. Realizing this made me realize I wasn't in love with him anymore, and all of a sudden I didn't really want to have sex with him either because, I mean, Florida is a lot of effort for some booty. He said I emasculated him, but he didn't really want to be there for me either so I guess we're even. -->
    -   I'm trying to love myself more, so that's why I write all these TILs about life and check myself out in the mirror and watch imposter syndrome talks and go to November Project even though it's a cult. #selfcare
-   Maybe there's a better word than `love` for what I'm describing, but that's how I'm going with this for now because who even really knows what love is tbh. Romance isn't love, but love can have romance. May edit the above bullet as I discover more about life.

<!--
-  **I don't think about my good exes as much as I think about Jason.** There's a lot I wish I could have told 18-year-old me, but I can't, so I told 나윤 the other day. She was so fucking cool about it. Six years ago I didn't even know if it counted as rape, and there were all those Republicans trying to define it for us. 나 is fifteen and when I told her I used to hate myself because I didn't know what to call it, she immediately said, "No, that's exactly what he did. He pressured you." I almost cried. She's so freaking wonderful, and I feel like I got six years' worth of anxiety and shit off my chest because I shared that with her and because of how she responded. **Obviously I still struggle and have a hard time in certain situations, but her saying that reminds me that I'm surrounded by people who love me and who will listen.** -->

## Habits
-   Nervous habits:
    -   Playing with my hair
    -   Cracking my knees
    -   Cracking my neck
    -   Cracking my knuckles

## Other
-   I think my athletic endurance _might_ be better when I'm listening to classical music. **Look into this later.**
