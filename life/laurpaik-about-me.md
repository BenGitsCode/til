# Stuff I learn about myself

This isn't, like, a real one, but I learn new things about myself all the time,
and sometimes it's important to have little reminders about it. This'll be more
like a bulleted list tbh and I don't really plan on pushing this branch let
alone submitting a pull request lolol but if it accidentally ends up online...
plz disregard

### Personality
-   I like to think I don't need validation, but I do.
-   I don't like being around large groups of people as much as I thought I did.
-   I have a hard time trusting people who talk too quickly when they pitch something to me.
-   I also have a hard time trusting people who are very clearly withholding information from me.
    -   I'm talking about recruiters, specifically.

### Gender and Sexuality
-   rant: This may or may not make me a hypocrite, but I really don't like when dudes use the word 'pussy'. I've definitely used it before in kind of a humorous context, but never around people I didn't know very well, and I've never used it seriously. It's just one of those words. I wouldn't say 'cunt' in front of people I didn't know either. Idk it's like I'll say 'bitch' every now and then the way straight women say 'girlfriend', but gendered insults aren't really fun when it comes from dudes who use them to demean, especially when one of the people they're referring to is a woman.

### Health - Use this if you notice something that you kind of want checked out
