# Stuff I learn about myself

This isn't, like, a real one, but I learn new things about myself all the time, and sometimes it's important to have little reminders about it. This'll be more like a bulleted list tbh and I don't really plan on submitting a pull request for this anyway.

## Personality

-   I like to think I don't need validation, but I do.
-   I don't like being around large groups of people as much as I thought I did.
-   I have a hard time trusting people who talk too quickly when they pitch something to me.
-   I also have a hard time trusting people who are very clearly withholding information from me.
    -   I'm talking about recruiters, specifically.

<!-- -   I'm more afraid of elevators than I remembered. I think a lot of the claustrophobia aspect comes from Jason. I don't know if it's worse to be stuck in one by myself or fine but with too many people. Probably the former, but being afraid of the latter means I'll never be stuck in one with too many people, so there's that. -->

## Gender and Sexuality

-   rant: This may or may not make me a hypocrite, but **I really don't like when dudes use the word 'pussy'.** I've definitely used it before in kind of a humorous context, but never around people I didn't know very well, and I've never used it seriously. It's just one of those words. I wouldn't say 'cunt' in front of people I didn't know either. Idk it's like I'll say 'bitch' every now and then the way straight women say 'girlfriend', but gendered insults aren't really fun when it comes from dudes who use them to demean, especially when one of the people they're referring to is a woman.


-   **I think I love myself more if I take a minute every day to look at myself naked in the mirror.** Bodies are beautiful. I forget that about myself a lot, especially when clothes don't fit properly. When I'm naked and I look at myself in the mirror, I remember I'm beautiful and sexy and cool and _human_.


-   I don't really know when I learned this, but I've started to realize that **love is not a feeling, it's a commitment.** I think if I'm committed to someone both physically and mentally, I can say I love them. Physical commitment doesn't mean sex, it's a willingness to respect others' physical needs/be there for them. Love comes in different flavors and you can have different kinds of love for different people. **Love just defines the level of commitment you have to a person.**
    -   I drive grandma to K-town and carry tables for her and send her letters.
    -   My parents visit each other even though they don't technically have to and even though financially it'd probably behoove them to not.
    -   Lex and I call each other every now and then. We're both committed to staying in touch. We love each other as friends. Same goes for Xhepa and Cara and Zach and Brian.
    -   Sparkle Motion goes to Jeff's every year. More friend-love.
    -   There's a bunch of people I've met that I'm friends with and really like, but I haven't been committed to staying in touch with them the way I have been for certain other people, so I wouldn't say I love them. They don't really keep in touch either, so it's all gucci.
    -   Arun and I didn't work out because I wasn't willing to move to bumblefuck Florida for him. Realizing this made me realize I wasn't in love with him anymore, and all of a sudden I didn't really want to have sex with him either because, I mean, Florida is a lot of effort for some booty. He said I emasculated him, but he didn't really want to be there for me either so I guess we're even.
    -   I'm trying to love myself more, so that's why I write all these TILs about life/make efforts to remember cool things about myself and watch imposter syndrome talks and go to November Project even though it's a cult. #selfcare

<!--
-  **I don't think about my good exes as much as I think about Jason.** There's a lot I wish I could have told 18-year-old me, but I can't, so I told 나윤 the other day. She was so fucking cool about it. Six years ago I didn't even know if it counted as rape, and there were all those Republicans trying to define it for us. 나 is fifteen and when I told her I used to hate myself because I didn't know what to call it, she immediately said, "No, that's exactly what he did. He pressured you." I almost cried. She's so freaking wonderful, and I feel like I got six years' worth of anxiety and shit off my chest because I shared that with her and because of how she responded. **Obviously I still struggle and have a hard time in certain situations, but her saying that reminds me that I'm surrounded by people who love me and who will listen.** -->

## Habits
-   Nervous habits:
    -   Playing with my hair
    -   Cracking my knees
    -   Cracking my neck
    -   Cracking my knuckles
    -   Adjusting my clothes


-   I complain for the sake of complaining. If I don't get to complain every now and then, I actually end up having a harder time when something real comes up. #debbieDowner amiright
