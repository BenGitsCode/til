# Stuff I learn about myself

This isn't, like, a real one, but I learn new things about myself all the time, and sometimes it's important to have little reminders about it. This'll be more like a bulleted list tbh and I don't really plan on pushing this branch let alone submitting a pull request lolol but if it accidentally ends up online... plz disregard

## Personality

-   I like to think I don't need validation, but I do.
-   I don't like being around large groups of people as much as I thought I did.
-   I have a hard time trusting people who talk too quickly when they pitch something to me.
-   I also have a hard time trusting people who are very clearly withholding information from me.
    -   I'm talking about recruiters, specifically.
<!-- -   I'm more afraid of elevators than I remembered. I think a lot of the claustrophobia aspect comes from Jason. I don't know if it's worse to be stuck in one by myself or fine but with too many people. Probably the former, but being afraid of the latter means I'll never be stuck in one with too many people, so there's that. -->

## Gender and Sexuality

-   rant: This may or may not make me a hypocrite, but **I really don't like when dudes use the word 'pussy'.** I've definitely used it before in kind of a humorous context, but never around people I didn't know very well, and I've never used it seriously. It's just one of those words. I wouldn't say 'cunt' in front of people I didn't know either. Idk it's like I'll say 'bitch' every now and then the way straight women say 'girlfriend', but gendered insults aren't really fun when it comes from dudes who use them to demean, especially when one of the people they're referring to is a woman.


-   **I think I love myself more if I take a minute every day to look at myself naked in the mirror.** Bodies are beautiful. I forget that about myself a lot, especially when clothes don't fit properly. When I'm naked and I look at myself in the mirror, I remember I'm beautiful and sexy and cool and _human_.

<!--
-  **I don't think about my good exes as much as I think about Jason.** There's a lot I wish I could have told 18-year-old me, but I can't, so I told 나윤 the other day. She was so fucking cool about it. Six years ago I didn't even know if it counted as rape, and there were all those Republicans trying to define it for us. 나 is fifteen and when I told her I used to hate myself because I didn't know what to call it, she immediately said, "No, that's exactly what he did. He pressured you." I almost cried. She's so freaking wonderful, and I feel like I got six years' worth of anxiety and shit off my chest because I shared that with her and because of how she responded. **Obviously I still struggle and have a hard time in certain situations, but her saying that reminds me that I'm surrounded by people who love me and who will listen.** -->

## Habits
-   Nervous habits:
    -   Playing with my hair
    -   Cracking my knees
    -   Cracking my neck
    -   Cracking my knuckles
    -   Adjusting my clothes


-   I complain for the sake of complaining. If I don't get to complain every now and then, I actually end up having a harder time when something real comes up. #debbieDowner amiright
