# Stuff I learn about myself

This isn't, like, a real one, but I learn new things about myself all the time,
and sometimes it's important to have little reminders about it. This'll be more
like a bulleted list tbh and I don't really plan on pushing this branch let
alone submitting a pull request lolol but if it accidentally ends up online...
plz disregard


- I like to think I don't need validation, but I do.
- I don't like being around large groups of people as much as I thought I did.
