# Documentation can be sexist

This is one of those things that never occurred to me, but once someone pointed
it out I realized I'm not that surprised. (Thanks @raq929)

Part of it's that I'm new to tech, so a lot of the examples I've seen were
written by the people who taught me and who consciously make an effort to
provide mixed-gender examples or use gender-neutral language [(like saying
'user' or 'they' instead of 'he' or
'she')](https://alexgaynor.net/2013/nov/30/gender-neutral-language-faq/).

I guess when I was a kid I noticed it a lot more when 'non-white' names were
given as examples. Most of my childhood education gave example names like John
or Mary in math problems etc, but I didn't realize it until we got an example
with Jos√© and Maria one year.

Either way, representation matters. Only seeing men's names in
documentation examples (or only seeing women's names as examples for 500 errors
or something negative) can be pretty discouraging, especially since tech is
notoriously male-dominated. Even men who consciously make efforts to combat
gender issues can still fall into [sexist patterns](https://notapattern.net/2014/10/14/ways-men-in-tech-are-unintentionally-sexist/), so it's important to keep these things in mind when writing anything
involving people/users.
