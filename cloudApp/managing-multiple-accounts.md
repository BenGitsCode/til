# Today I learned... A Workflow for managing multiple CloudApp Accounts.

Let's say you find yourself having a personal CloudApp account and separate business acount for work? How do you juggle between the two?

CloudApp doesn't (yet) support that feature--but it's actually pretty easy to manage on your own. It's not perfect, but this is what's working for me so far.

1. At the start of a workday I open the CloudApp with menu with `CMD`+`OPTION`+`C` or by clicking the menu icon.

1. *note* turn off auto upload.
use separate screenshots for personal and then batch upload end of day.
