# Today I learned... A Workflow for managing multiple CloudApp Accounts.

Let's say you find yourself having a personal CloudApp account and separate business acount for work? How do you juggle between the two?

CloudApp doesn't (yet) support that feature--but it's actually pretty easy to manage on your own. It's not perfect, but this is what's working for me so far.

1. At the start of a workday I open the CloudApp with menu with `CMD`+`OPTION`+`C` or by clicking the menu icon.
1. I sign out and sign into my work account.
> This is the most tedious step, but I've found it made a bit simpler by opening my password manager and sizing the window to be smaller on the left side.
Copy the user and then open CloudApp with the keyboard, paste, tab or click back to the password manager, open cloudapp, paste, enter. This can be done in just a few seconds, and without leaving the keyboard.


*optional* turn off auto upload.
- This is a preference: I use separate screenshots for personal stuff (the default `CMD+SHFT+4`) and only upload screenshots using CloudApp `CMD+SHIFT+5` to my work account, and then when I switch accounts at the end of the day, I just drag and drop the days personal screenshots to my account.

This is just what works for me but the moral of this TIL is that managing multiple accounts is made so much easier by using the keyboard shortcuts to quickly switch accounts. Even if you don't use a password manager, a text editor/note with your password and email would make the process _almost_ painless. ðŸ˜Ž
