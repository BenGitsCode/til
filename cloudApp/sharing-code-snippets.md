# You Can Quickly Save And Share Any Text As Snippets

TIL that not only can you very easily, very quickly save, upload and share, code snippets using [CloudApp](https://www.getcloudapp.com/?utm_source=bengitscode_github1), but in trying to find a good way to show how cool it is, I discovered that I can even use [CloudApp](https://cl.ly/kQ05) to record me doing things with [CloudApp](https://my.cl.ly/r/1z0B1n231Z131C0Q). So meta!

Here's an example of me using it.

1.  Copy the link.
1.  Click and drag the link to [CloudApp](https://www.getcloudapp.com/?utm_source=bengitscode_github4) in the menu bar.
1.  The short link is generated (you can use long, its a setting in preferences) and copied to the clipboard.
1.  Paste and voila! You have now have a easily shareable code snippet that retains syntax highlighting and gets converted to raw text.
