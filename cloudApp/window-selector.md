# Today I learned...

I discovered a new little CloudApp trick I've never noticed before. It seems like something that would save some time and gesturing for
the right use case.


As you probably know by now if you ‚ù§ CloudApp as much as I do, sometimes you want a screenshot of an entire window. In all my time CloudAppin', I've always manually dragged a selection area over a window. Not only does this take a few seconds and require some wrist movement (something I'm painfully mindful of with some recent RSI pain) but I don't know about you, I'm not perfect. Which means I often bork my cropping in away that is still usable, but maybe has a sliver of white outside the window, or some other content.

Turns out I've been doing it all wrong. Maybe this has feature has been there a while and I've somehow missed it, or maybe it was in the new update and I was too busy going üçå's over the new annotation features. I'm still amazed by how much I can nest CloudApp actions within each other. Taking a video of me making another, or annotating a screenshot. I haven't found a CloudApp feature that can't be shared using the tool itself--it's like Matryoshka doll of productivity üôå.

## Examples of use

1. Simply go to make a gif/video recording `CMD + SHFT + 6` by default.
1. Before clicking and dragging a selection area, simply hit the `spacebar`
1. You'll be given a little camera icon and the ability to highlight any open window with it.
1. On click, it will save a screenshot of just that window.
