## Contribute

See [the contribute file](contribute.md)!

PRs accepted. This is mostly for my own purposes, as a place to store concise tidbits from daily learning but I'm happy to accept contributions that format it better,
or even if you'd like to share something interesting _you_ learned today, I can add you to the maintainers.

Anything I make asks that contributors adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/) Code of Conduct.
